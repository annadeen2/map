        <h3>The Internet Master Plan, which the City expects to roll out in 2021, has been criticized by housing advocates who say this plan is not being implemented quickly enough for people, particularly students, living in shelters.</h3>
        <h3>According to the plan, 18% of all New York City residents do not have internet access. Those living below the poverty line are disproportionately affected, with 46% of households being without home broadband. To address <a href="https://iei.ncsu.edu/2020/digital-redlining/">"digital redlining,"</a> the City will invest $157 million in providing high-speed internet access to New Yorkers.</h3>

    <h3>Although the plan was <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/010-20/de-blasio-administration-releases-internet-master-plan-city-s-broadband-future">released</a> in January, it wasn’t until July that Mayor Bill de Blasio <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/499-20/mayor-de-blasio-taskforce-racial-inclusion-equity-accelerated-internet-master">added</a> that the initiative would prioritize homeless shelters and communities hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic.
  </h3>
  <h3>Lisa Pearlstein, the Project Director for the City Bar Justice Center’s Legal Clinic for the Homeless, says that many of her clients go through great lengths to get internet access. One of Pearlstein’s clients has had to use nearly half of their cash assistance each month to pay for a cellular plan that would allow their child to attend school.

  <h3>Pearlstein says that while some shelters have computer rooms, they are often all but inaccessible for residents. She’s seen situations where only two computers are available for 140 units, which means that residents must wait in line for 15 minutes for their time slots.</h3>
  <h3>“Equipment malfunctions and they don’t have resources to repair equipment, or staff for the room,” she adds. As a result, even the well-intentioned staff members keep the doors locked.</h3>
  <h3>Anyone who would normally use the internet and printing services at public computer centers and libraries can no longer do so because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</h3>
